# nail_'s Keylogger Project
<h3> DISCLAIMER: THIS PROJECT WAS JUST FOR FUN, DO NOT USE FOR MALICIOUS INTENT. I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY REAL-WORLD ISSUES CAUSED BY THIS PROGRAM.</h3>

<p>This code has 72 lines of code and written in python exclusively.

<h4> How do I work this thing? </h4>
Opening keyloggerproj.exe, change EMAIL_ADDRESS to a Gmail address and EMAIL_PASSWORD to the password. Use pyinstaller to convert the program into an executable. 

<h4> How does it work? </h4>
The .exe runs in the background, logging every keystroke, and sending that keystroke to the email.

<h4> Is there an interval for every message sent to the email? </h4>
It will send an email every 20 seconds, although, this can be changed by changing the value of SEND_REPORT_EVERY.

<h4> Can I use the .exe embedded? </h4>
Sure, though, the .exe will send it to no email, it's just an example on how the program would look like.
